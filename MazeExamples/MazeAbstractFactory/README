Description:
    This project is based on the Maze example from the "Creational Patterns" section of "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" for the purposes of studying the Factory Method and Abstract Factory Patterns.
    This version implements the Factory Method through the MapFactory class as done in the book. This seems good, but I wonder how I can easily decide which factory to use at runtime? I could use logic to choose which factory, but then it would feel like I should have a factory to build those factories that would need a subclass for each, which doesn't solve anything. Is it appropriate at this point to use a switch/if selector to pick a factory, in this case, in main.cpp?
